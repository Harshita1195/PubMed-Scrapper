This work applies artificial intelligence and systems biology-based mathematical modeling strategies to unveil potential treatments by computationally analyzing and integrating available molecular and clinical data from patients. The mathematical models of embryo implantation computationally generated here simulate the molecular networks underneath this biological process. Once generated, these models were analyzed in order to identify potential repositioned drugs (drugs already used for other indications) able to improve embryo implantation by modulating the molecular pathways involved. Interestingly, the repositioning analysis has identified drugs considering two endpoints: (1) drugs able to modulate the activity of proteins whose role in embryo implantation is already bibliographically acknowledged, and (2) drugs that modulate key proteins in embryo implantation previously predicted through a mechanistic analysis of the mathematical models. This second approach increases the scope open for examination and potential novelty of the repositioning strategy. As a result, a list of 23 drug candidates to improve embryo implantation after IVF was identified by the mathematical models. This list includes many of the compounds already tested for this purpose, which reinforces the predictive capacity of our approach, together with novel repositioned candidates (e.g., Infliximab, Polaprezinc, and Amrinone). In conclusion, the present study exploits existing molecular and clinical information to offer new hypotheses regarding molecular mechanisms in embryo implantation and therapeutic candidates to improve it. This information will be very useful to guide future research.Abbreviations: IVF: in vitro fertilization; EI: Embryo implantation; TPMS: Therapeutic Performance Mapping System; MM: mathematical models; ANN: Artificial Neuronal Networks; TNF\u03b1: tumour necrosis factor factor-alpha; HSPs: heat shock proteins; VEGF: vascular endothelial growth factor; PPARA: peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-\u03b1 PXR: pregnane X receptor; TTR: transthyretin; BED: Biological Effectors Database; MLP: multilayer perceptron."}, {"Authors": "G.

Nevertheless, IVF does not guarantee success in the fertilization. Choosing IVF is burdensome for the reason of high cost and uncertainty in the result. As the complications and fertilization factors are numerous in the IVF process, it is a cumbersome task for fertility doctors to give an accurate prediction of a successful birth. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been employed in this study for predicting the live-birth occurrence. This work mainly focuses on making predictions of live-birth occurrence when an embryo forms from a couple and not a donor. Here, we compare various AI algorithms, including both classical Machine Learning, deep learning architecture, and an ensemble of algorithms on the publicly available dataset provided by Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA). Insights on data and metrics such as confusion matrices, F1-score, precision, recall, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves are demonstrated in the subsequent sections. The training process has two settings Without feature selection and With feature selection to train classifier models. Machine Learning, Deep learning, ensemble models classification paradigms have been trained in both settings. The Random Forest model achieves the highest F1-score of 76.49% in without feature selection setting. For the same model, the precision, recall, and area under the ROC Curve (ROC AUC) scores are 77%, 76%, and 84.60%, respectively.

A combination of these disadvantages, undeterred by the introduction of the time-lapse incubator technology, has been considered as a prominent contributor to the less preferable success rate of IVF cycles.

An AI-powered assistant could improve the efficiency of performing certain tasks in addition to offering accurate algorithms that behave as baselines to minimize the subjectivity of the decision-making process.

The AI models are evaluated based on their ability to identify the embryo(s) with the highest chance(s) of achieving a successful pregnancy. Whether such evaluations should be based on ranking performance or pregnancy prediction, however, seems to divide studies. As such, a variety of performance metrics are reported, and comparisons between studies are often made on different outcomes and data foundations. Moreover, superiority of AI methods over manual human evaluation is often claimed based on retrospective data, without any mentions of potential bias. In this paper, we provide a technical view on some of the major topics that divide how current AI models are trained, evaluated and compared. We explain and discuss the most common evaluation metrics and relate them to the two separate evaluation objectives, ranking and prediction.

In the same trend, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques is being intensively researched whether in the embryo or spermatozoa selection. Despite several studies already published, the use of AI within assisted reproduction clinics is not yet a reality. This is largely due to the different AI techniques that are being proposed to be used in the daily routine of the clinics, which causes some uncertainty in their use. To shed light on this complex scenario, this review briefly describes some of the most frequently used AI algorithms, their functionalities, and their potential use. Several databases were analyzed in search of articles where applied artificial intelligence algorithms were used on reproductive data. Our focus was on the classification of embryonic cells and semen samples. Of a total of 124 articles analyzed, 32 were selected for this review. From the proposed algorithms, most have achieved a satisfactory precision, demonstrating the potential of a wide range of AI techniques. However, the evaluation of these studies suggests the need for more standardized research to validate the proposed models and their algorithms. Routine use of AI in assisted reproduction clinics is just a matter of time. However, the choice of AI technique to be used is supported by a better understanding of the principles subjacent to each technique, that is, its robustness, pros, and cons. We provide some current (although incipient) and potential uses of AI on the clinic routine, discussing how accurate and friendly it could be. Finally, we propose some standards for AI research on the selection of the embryo to be transferred and other future hints.

In this study, we used quantitative proteomic analyses to investigate potential biomarkers that can predict poor response during in vitro fertilization based on follicular fluid samples. A total of 1079 proteins were identified using a high-resolution orbitrap mass spectrometer coupled online to a nanoflow-LC system.

However, the assessment produces different results between embryologists and as a result, the success rate of IVF remains low. To overcome uncertainties in embryo quality, multiple embryos are often implanted resulting in undesired multiple pregnancies and complications. Unlike in other imaging fields, human embryology and IVF have not yet leveraged artificial intelligence (AI) for unbiased, automated embryo assessment. We postulated that an AI approach trained on thousands of embryos can reliably predict embryo quality without human intervention. We implemented an AI approach based on deep neural networks (DNNs) to select highest quality embryos using a large collection of human embryo time-lapse images (about 50,000 images) from a high-volume fertility center in the United States. We developed a framework (STORK) based on Google's Inception model. STORK predicts blastocyst quality with an AUC of >0.98 and generalizes well to images from other clinics outside the US and outperforms individual embryologists. Using clinical data for 2182 embryos, we created a decision tree to integrate embryo quality and patient age to identify scenarios associated with pregnancy likelihood. Our analysis shows that the chance of pregnancy based on individual embryos varies from 13.8% (age\u2009\u226541 and poor-quality) to 66.3% (age\u2009<37 and good-quality) depending on automated blastocyst quality assessment and patient age.

Using three-dimensional (3D) printers can provide materials that mimic real tissues and also helps trainees to practice on a realistic model. Furthermore, 3D imaging allows better depth perception than its two-dimensional (2D) counterpart, allowing the surgeon to create preoperative plans according to tissue depth and dimensions. Although AI has some limitations, this new technology can improve the prognosis and management of patients, reduce healthcare costs, and help OB/GYN practitioners to reduce their workload and increase their efficiency and accuracy by incorporating AI systems into their daily practice.

Attempts to correlate patterns of oocyte gene expression with successful embryo development have been hampered by the lack of reliable and nondestructive predictors of viability at such an early stage. Here we report that zygote viscoelastic properties can predict blastocyst formation in humans and mice within hours after fertilization, with >90% precision, 95% specificity and 75% sensitivity. We demonstrate that there are significant differences between the transcriptomes of viable and non-viable zygotes, especially in expression of genes important for oocyte maturation. In addition, we show that low-quality oocytes may undergo insufficient cortical granule release and zona-hardening, causing altered mechanics after fertilization. Our results suggest that embryo potential is largely determined by the quality and maturation of the oocyte before fertilization, and can be predicted through a minimally invasive mechanical measurement at the zygote stage.

Given the uncertainty of the treatment, we propose an intelligent decision support system based on supervised classification by Bayesian classifiers to aid to the selection of the most promising embryos that will form the batch to be transferred to the woman's uterus. The aim of the supervised classification system is to improve overall success rate of each IVF treatment in which a batch of embryos is transferred each time, where the success is achieved when implantation (i.e. pregnancy) is obtained. Due to ethical reasons, different legislative restrictions apply in every country on this technique. In Spain, legislation allows a maximum of three embryos to form each transfer batch. As a result, clinicians prefer to select the embryos by non-invasive embryo examination based on simple methods and observation focused on morphology and dynamics of embryo development after fertilization. This paper proposes the application of Bayesian classifiers to this embryo selection problem in order to provide a decision support system that allows a more accurate selection than with the actual procedures which fully rely on the expertise and experience of embryologists. For this, we propose to take into consideration a reduced subset of feature variables related to embryo morphology and clinical data of patients, and from this data to induce Bayesian classification models.

The global final objective is the development of an automatic intra cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) device in order to improve performances and ergonomics of current devices. In the future this new device will contain various modules: module for removal of cumulus cells, modules for characterization of oocytes, microinjection module, cells transport system. The first subsystem developed is a new single cell transport system. It consists in a so-called micropusher which pushes single cells without having contact with the external environment. This micropusher is a ferromagnetic particle (from 400 x 400 x 20 microm3 to 100 x 100 x 5 microm3) which follows the movement of a permanent magnet located under the biological medium. A 2D micro-positioning table moves this magnet under the glass slide. The pusher and cells positions are measured through an optical microscope with a CCD camera located above the biological medium. The second subsystem is developed to measure oocytes mechanical stiffness in order to sort them. We have then developed a micro/nano-force sensor based on the diamagnetic levitation principle: a glass tip end-effector (with 20 microm in diameter) is fixed on the equipment which is in levitation (0.5 mm in diameter, 100 mm in length). When a force is applied to the levitated glass tip, it moves to a new equilibrium position. Thanks to themeasurement of this displacement, the applied force can be measured. Since there is no contact and friction between the levitated tip and the fixed part, the resolution of this sensor is very high (10 nN)."}, {"Authors": "CL. Bormann, CL. Curchoe, P.

High-throughput gene expression analysis has been extensively used to explore mechanisms responsible for these disorders. Our study, for the first time, provides a comparative proteomic analysis between embryos after in vivo fertilization and development (IVO, control) and in vitro fertilization and culture (IVP). By comparing the dynamic proteome during the postimplantation period, we identified 300 and 262 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) between IVO and IVP embryos at embryonic day 7.5 (E7.5) and E10.5, respectively. Bioinformatic analysis showed many DEPs functionally associated with post-transcriptional, translational, and post-translational regulation, and these observations were consistent with correlation analysis between mRNA and protein abundance. In addition to altered gene expression due to IVP procedures, our findings suggest that aberrant processes at these various levels also contributed to proteomic alterations. In addition, numerous DEPs were involved in energy and amino acid metabolism, as well as neural and sensory development. These DEPs are potential candidates for further exploring the mechanism(s) of ART-induced intrauterine growth restriction and neurodevelopmental disorders. Moreover, significant enrichment of DEPs in pathways of neurodegenerative diseases implies the potentially increased susceptibility of ART offspring to these conditions as adults. "}, {"Authors": "K.

Time-lapse technology introduces the concept of stable culture conditions, in connection with the possibility of continuous viewing and documenting of the embryo throughout development. However, so far, even when embryo quality scoring is based on large datasets, or when using the time-lapse technology, the morphokinetic scores are still mainly based on subjective and intermittent annotations of morphology and timings.

Follicles are tracked over the in-vitro fertilization (IVF) cycle, and this analysis is usually performed manually by a medical practitioner. It is a challenging manual analysis and is prone to error as it is largely operator dependent. In this paper we propose a two-stage framework to address the clinical need for follicular growth tracking. The first stage comprises of an unsupervised deep learning network SFR-Net to automate registration of each and every follicle across the IVF cycle. SFR-Net is composed of the standard 3DUNet [1] and Multi-Scale Residual Blocks (MSRB) [2] in order to register follicles of varying sizes. In the second stage we use the registration result to track individual follicles across the IVF cycle. The 3D Transvaginal Ultrasound (3D TVUS) volumes were acquired from 26 subjects every 2-3 days, resulting in a total of 96 volume pairs for the registration and tracking task. On the test dataset we have achieved an average DICE score of 85.84% for the follicle registration task, and we are successfully able to track follicles above 4 mm. Ours is the novel attempt towards automated tracking of follicular growth [3].Clinical Relevance- Accurate tracking of follicle count and growth is of paramount importance to increase the effectiveness of IVF procedure. Correct predictions can help doctors provide better counselling to the patients and individualize treatment for ovarian stimulation.

However, previous studies attempting to establish the relationship between trophectoderm gene expression profiles and implantation competency using either microarrays or RNA sequencing strategies, were not sufficiently optimized to handle the exceptionally low RNA inputs available from biopsied material. In this pilot study, we report that differential gene expression in human trophectoderm biopsies assayed by an ultra-sensitive next generation RNA sequencing strategy could predict blastocyst implantation competence. RNA expression profiles from isolated human trophectoderm cells were analysed with established clinical pregnancy being the primary endpoint. Following RNA sequencing, a total of 47 transcripts were found to be significantly differentially expressed between the trophectoderm cells from successfully implanted (competent) versus unsuccessful (incompetent) blastocysts. Of these, 36 transcripts were significantly down-regulated in the incompetent blastocysts, including Hydroxysteroid 17-Beta Dehydrogenase 1 (HSD17B1) and Cytochrome P450 Family 11 Subfamily A Member 1 (CYP11A1), while the remaining 11 transcripts were significantly up-regulated, including BCL2 Antagonist/Killer 1 (BAK1) and KH Domain Containing 1 Pseudogene 1 (KHDC1P1) of which the latter was always detected in the incompetent and absent in all competent blastocysts. Ontological analysis of differentially expressed RNAs revealed pathways involved in steroidogenic processes with high confidence. Novel differentially expressed transcripts were also noted by reference to a de novo sequence assembly. The selection of the blastocyst with the best potential to support full-term pregnancy following single embryo transfer could reduce the need for multiple treatment cycles and embryo transfers. The main limitation was the low sample size (N\u00a0=\u00a08). Despite this shortcoming, the pilot suggests that trophectoderm biopsy could assist with the selection of healthy embryos for embryo transfer.

A retrospective study was performed. For the training data group, 110 couples were included and, 891 embryos were cultured. For the global setting data group, 201 couples were included, and 1186 embryos were cultured. No image analysis was used; morphokinetic parameters from the first three days of embryo culture were used to perform a logistic regression between the cell number and time. A score named DynScore was constructed, the prediction power of the DynScore on blastocyst formation and the baby delivery were tested via the area under the curve (AUC) obtained from the receiver operating characteristic (ROC). In the training data group, the DynScore allowed the blastocyst formation prediction (AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.634, p <\u00a00.001), this approach was the higher among the set of the tested scores. Similar results were found with the global setting data group (AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.638, p <\u00a00.001) and it was possible to increase the AUC of the DynScore with a regular update of the prediction system by reinforcement, with an AUC able to reach a value above 0.9. As only the best blastocysts were transferred, none of the tested scores was able to predict delivery. In conclusion, the DynScore seems to be able to predict the fate of an embryo. The reinforcement of the prediction system allows maintaining the predictive capacity of DynScore irrespective of the various events that may occur during the ART process. The DynScore could be implemented in any TLM system and adapted by itself to the data of any ART center.Abbreviations: ART: assisted reproduction technology; TLM: time lapse monitoring system; AUC: area under the curve; ROC: receiver operating characteristic; eSET: elective single embryo transfer; AIS: artificial intelligence system; KID: known implantation data; AMH: anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone; BMI: body mass index; WHO: World Health Organization; c-IVF: conventional in-vitro fertilization; ICSI: intracytoplasmic sperm injection; PNf: pronuclear formation; D3: day 3; D5: day 5; D6: day 6; GnRH: gonadotrophin releasing hormone; FSH: follicle stimulating hormone; LH: luteinizing hormone; hCG: human chorionic gonadotropin; PVP: polyvinyl pyrrolidone; PNf: time of pronuclear fading; tx: time of cleavage to x blastomeres embryo; ICM: inner cell mass; TE: trophectoderm; NbCellt: number of cells at t time; FIFO: first in first out; TD: training data group; SD: setting data group; R: real world."}, {"Authors": "B.

Once treatment goals have been agreed and diagnostic evaluations performed, personalization based on patient characteristics, together with an understanding of treatment goals and patient preferences, enables the selection of appropriate treatments, protocols, products and their dosing. Following treatment initiation, monitoring and adaptation of product and dose can then ensure optimal outcomes. Currently, it is not possible to base treatment decisions on every characteristic of the patient and personalization is based on biomarkers that have been identified as the most relevant.

It is well recognized that only gametes achieving MII stage after in vivo or in vitro maturation (IVM) are successfully fertilized by a single spermatozoon. Although the process of oocyte nuclear and/or cytoplasmic maturation in pigs is well determined, there exist many differences that promote these processes in vivo and in vitro. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the differences in RNA expression profiles between porcine oocytes before and after IVM using microarray and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assays. Experiments were performed on oocytes isolated from 55 pubertal crossbred Landrace gilts. The oocytes were analyzed both before and after IVM and only Brilliant Cresyl Blue (BCB)-positive gametes were used for subsequent microarray analysis (Affymetrix) and RT-qPCR analysis. The microarray assay, which measures expression of 12,258 transcripts, revealed 419 differentially expressed transcripts in porcine oocytes, from which 379 were downregulated and 40 were upregulated before IVM compared to those analyzed after IVM. After DAVID analysis, we found eight different transcripts, including IHH, BMP1, WWTR1, CHRDL1, KLF10, EIF2AK3, MMP14, and STC1. Their expression is related to the \"bone development\" ontology group and was further subjected to hierarchical clusterization. Using RT-qPCR analysis, we confirmed the results of the microarray assay, showing increased expression of the eight genes in oocytes before IVM compared to oocytes after maturation in vitro. It has been suggested that \"bone development\" belongs to one ontological group involving genes substantially upregulated in porcine oocytes before IVM. We suggest that the gamete mRNA expression profile before IVM may comprise stored transcripts, which are templates for protein biosynthesis following fertilization. We also hypothesize that these mRNAs may be a specific \"fingerprint\" of folliculogenesis and oogenesis in pigs."}, {"Authors": "SJ. Kaufmann, JL. Eastaugh, S. Snowden, SW. Smye and V.

In this review we report, for the first time, all the proteins unambiguously detected in HFF and, applying DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery) and MetaCore bioinformatic resources, we shed new lights on their functional correlation, delineating protein patterns and pathways with reasonable potentialities for oocyte quality estimation in in vitro fertilisation (IVF) programs. Performing a rigorous PubMed search, we redacted a list of 617 unique proteins unambiguously-annotated as HFF components. Their functional processing suggested the occurrence in HFF of a tight and highly dynamic functional-network, which is balanced by specific effectors, primarily involved in extracellular matrix degradation and remodelling, inflammation and coagulation. Metalloproteinases, thrombin and vitamin-D-receptor/retinoid-X-receptor-alpha resulted as the main key factors in the nets and their differential activity may be indicative of ovarian health and oocyte quality.

This study was aimed to first demonstrate the mRNA expression profile of cell migration markers during different stages of porcine oocytes maturation and developmental capability in vitro. The COCs were collected from a total of 45 pubertal crossbred Landrace gilts, brilliant cresyl blue (BCB) stained, and analyzed before (n\u2009=\u2009150) or after (n\u2009=\u2009150) in vitro maturation (IVM). Using the Affymetrix\u00ae Porcine Gene 1.1 ST Array, the expression profile of 12,258 porcine transcripts was examined. We found nine genes involved in cell migration mechanisms, that is, PLD1, KIT, LAMA2, MAP3K1, VEGFA, TGFBR3, INSR, TPM1, and RTN4. These genes were upregulated in porcine oocytes before IVM as compared with post-IVM expression analysis. Moreover, important mechanisms of biological interaction between VEGFA-KIT and VEGFA-INSR were also observed. The upregulation and/or downregulation of selected mRNAs expression after microarray assays was checked and approved by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. We suggest that several genes, including LAMA2 or TPM1, encode proteins participating in the formation of the oocyte's protein architecture such as microtubules and kinetochore reorganization. As the expression of all \"migration regulatory genes\" investigated in this study was significantly upregulated in oocytes before IVM, we conclude that they may contribute to the maturational capability of porcine oocytes. However, migration potency of COCs is not accompanied by achievement of the MII stage by porcine oocytes in vitro.

The oocytes were randomly distributed in the control group (no melatonin) and four other groups of varying melatonin concentrations (10\u201111, 10\u20119, 10\u20117, 10\u20115\u00a0mol/l). Gene profiling was performed on blastocysts developed from in\u00a0vivo maturation oocytes (in\u00a0vivo group), and in\u00a0vitro maturation (IVM) oocytes with an optimal concentration of melatonin treatment (IVM\u2011anti group) or without melatonin (IVM group). The ratio of high quality blastocysts was significantly higher in the groups treated with 10\u20115\u00a0mol/l melatonin compared with others groups. The large\u2011scale analysis of the transcriptome revealed significant differences in mRNA expression levels. In each group, nine blastocysts were selected for gene expression profiling. The differentially expressed genes were involved in cysteine and methionine metabolism, regulation of apoptotic process, mineral absorption, steroid hormone biosynthesis, Wnt signaling, p53 signaling pathway and other functions. The findings indicated that the IVM procedure may potentially affect DNA methylation and the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. Exogenous melatonin positively influenced quality of blastocysts, which may be mediated via upregulation of p53 signaling and correcting DNA methylation changes caused by 'rescue IVM'. However, this study reflected what was generally referred to as 'rescue IVM' and was not a true reflection of clinical IVM techniques. Therefore, melatonin required further investigation as a promising supplement for use in IVM."}, {"Authors": "CL. Lu, ZQ. Yan, XL. Song, YY. Xu, XY. Zheng, R. Li, P. Liu, HL. Feng and J.

We developed an automated, quantitative method that objectively classifies five distinct motility patterns of mouse sperm using Support Vector Machines (SVM), a common method in supervised machine learning. This multiclass SVM model is based on more than 2000 sperm tracks that were captured by computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA) during in vitro capacitation and visually classified as progressive, intermediate, hyperactivated, slow, or weakly motile. Parameters associated with the classified tracks were incorporated into established SVM algorithms to generate a series of equations. These equations were integrated into a binary decision tree that sequentially sorts uncharacterized tracks into distinct categories. The first equation sorts CASA tracks into vigorous and nonvigorous categories. Additional equations classify vigorous tracks as progressive, intermediate, or hyperactivated and nonvigorous tracks as slow or weakly motile. Our CASAnova software uses these SVM equations to classify individual sperm motility patterns automatically. Comparisons of motility profiles from sperm incubated with and without bicarbonate confirmed the ability of the model to distinguish hyperactivated patterns of motility that develop during in vitro capacitation. The model accurately classifies motility profiles of sperm from a mutant mouse model with severe motility defects. Application of the model to sperm from multiple inbred strains reveals strain-dependent differences in sperm motility profiles. CASAnova provides a rapid and reproducible platform for quantitative comparisons of motility in large, heterogeneous populations of mouse sperm."}, {"Authors": "R. Milewski, J. Jamio\u0142kowski, J.

However, microinjection is an extremely laborious manual procedure, which makes it a critical bottleneck in the field and thus ripe for automation. Here, we present a computer-guided robot that automates the targeted microinjection of Drosophila melanogaster and zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos, two important model organisms in biological research. The robot uses a series of cameras to image an agar plate containing embryos at multiple magnifications and perspectives. This imaging is combined with machine learning and computer vision algorithms to pinpoint a location on the embryo for targeted microinjection with microscale precision. We demonstrate the utility of this microinjection robot to successfully microinject Drosophila melanogaster and zebrafish embryos. Results obtained indicate that the robotic microinjection approach can significantly increase the throughput of microinjection as compared to manual microinjection while maintaining survival rates comparable to human operators. In the future, this robotic platform can be used to perform high throughput microinjection experiments and can be extended to automatically microinject a host of organisms such as roundworms (Caenorhabditis elegans), mosquito (Culicidae) embryos, sea urchins (Echinoidea) and frog (Xenopus) oocytes."}, {"Authors": "R.

Three main level of integration can be envisioned depending on the complexity of the biological entity, ranging from the nanoscale to the macroscale. At the nanoscale, enzymes that catalyze biocompatible reactions can be used as power sources for self-propelled nanoparticles of different geometries and compositions, obtaining rather interesting active matter systems that acquire importance in the biomedical field as drug delivery systems. At the microscale, single enzymes are substituted by complete cells, such as bacteria or spermatozoa, whose self-propelling capabilities can be used to transport cargo and can also be used as drug delivery systems, for in vitro fertilization practices or for biofilm removal. Finally, at the macroscale, the combinations of millions of cells forming tissues can be used to power biorobotic devices or bioactuators by using muscle cells. Both cardiac and skeletal muscle tissue have been part of remarkable examples of untethered biorobots that can crawl or swim due to the contractions of the tissue and current developments aim at the integration of several types of tissue to obtain more realistic biomimetic devices, which could lead to the next generation of hybrid robotics. Tethered bioactuators, however, result in excellent candidates for tissue models for drug screening purposes or the study of muscle myopathies due to their three-dimensional architecture.
